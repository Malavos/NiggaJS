# NiggaJS
Repository for our public framework, NiggaJS. Simple framework focused on two-way and one-way databinding.


It's not a magical framework. The idea is simple: To provide a simple, easy way for two-way and one-way databinding, without messing with digest cycles, observables, no messy license agreements, no unnecessary polyfills. It's meant to be simple, rudimentary, basic. No jQuery dependance either!


English is not my native language. If you have questions, ask them in the issues. I'll try to answer to the best of my skills.
