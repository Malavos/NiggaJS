# RealN.js
Repository for our public framework, RealN.js. Simple framework focused on two-way and one-way databinding.


It's not a magical framework. The idea is simple: To provide a simple, easy way for two-way and one-way databinding, without messing with digest cycles, observables, no messy license agreements, no unnecessary polyfills. It's meant to be simple, rudimentary, basic. No jQuery dependance either!


English is not my native language. If you have questions, ask them in the issues. I'll try to answer to the best of my skills.

## Planned features:

- One-way data-binding;
- Proper logging of errors, escaping out objects;
- Two-way data-binding, with an observable interface for input controls;
- Conditional for repeaters.

## What we will never do:

- Routing. This framework/helper will only deal with bindings. If you need a route, or a single framework for your spa, this ain't it.
